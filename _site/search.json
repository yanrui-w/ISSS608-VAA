It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories\nExample:\n\nYou have two competing options or hypotheses. Let’s call them Option A and Option B.\nYou collect some data or evidence. The Bayes Factor helps you assess how well the data supports Option A versus Option B.\nThe Bayes Factor gives you a ratio. If the Bayes Factor is greater than 1, it means the data supports Option A more than Option B. If it’s less than 1, it means the data supports Option B more than Option A.\nThe bigger the Bayes Factor, the stronger the evidence in favor of one option. A Bayes Factor of 10 means the data strongly supports one option over the other.\nThe smaller the Bayes Factor, the weaker the evidence. A Bayes Factor of 0.1 means the data weakly supports one option over the other."

Each data point has one residual. On the Q-Q plot, each dot represents one of these residuals, not the actual data points. The purpose of this plot is to see how the residuals compare to a normal distribution.\nreference line: x-axis is theoretical distribution quantiles (standard normal distribution quantiles), y-axis is sample quantile deviations. If sample data follows standard normal distribution, it should be a horizontal line at y=0, which is the reference line in this case.\nConclusion: the normality assumption of the linear regression model is not fully met.\n\n\nMiddle Range: In the middle range of the data (between about -2 and 2 on the x-axis), the residuals mostly follow the reference line. This suggests that in this range, the residuals are behaving as we would expect if they were normally distributed.\nTails: at both ends of the plot (the tails), the residuals deviate from the reference line. This is indicated by the points curving away from the line. In the left tail, the residuals are lower than expected for a normal distribution, and in the right tail, they are higher than expected. The residuals have heavier tails than a normal distribution, which means there are more extreme values (outliers) than we would expect if the residuals were truly normal.\nIt might still be okay to use the model for predictions or to understand relationships between variables, especially if it’s for exploratory purposes or the sample size is large. However, if you are performing statistical tests that rely on the assumption of normally distributed residuals (like t-tests for coefficients), the results of those tests might not be entirely reliable. You might need to consider transformations of the data, robust statistical methods, or other models that do not assume normality of residuals."

    "section": "4.5 Model Diagnostic: Check homogeneity of variances",
    "text": "4.5 Model Diagnostic: Check homogeneity of variances\nhomogeneity of variances means “equal spread” or “equal variability” of different groups. It refers to the consistency of the spread or variance of the residuals across all levels of the independent variables.\nwhen you are doing an experiment or a study, you often want to make sure that the groups you are comparing are similar in terms of how spread out their data is. If one group has data that is all over the place and another group’s data is very tightly packed, it could be a problem for certain types of statistical tests which assume that the variances are equal across all groups being compared.\nExample:\nImagine you’re trying to predict the scores of students on a math test using the number of hours they studied. After everyone takes the test, you compare your predictions to the actual scores—the differences are called “residuals.”\nIf your predictions are equally reliable for students who studied a little and students who studied a lot, then the spread of those residuals will be pretty consistent. This is like saying whether a student studied for 2 hours or 10 hours, your prediction might be off by about 3 points on average either way. This consistency in prediction error is what we mean by “homogeneity of variance.”\nIf you notice that for students who studied a little, your predictions are really close, but for students who studied a lot, your predictions are way off—maybe you’re underestimating their scores. This means the spread of the residuals isn’t consistent. For those who studied a little, the residuals are small and clustered close together. For those who studied a lot, the residuals are large and spread out. This inconsistency is what we’d call “heteroscedasticity.”\n“homogeneity of variance” means your prediction mistakes are about the same size no matter how much someone studied. If that’s not the case, and your mistakes vary a lot depending on how much they studied, then there’s a problem with “heteroscedasticity”.\nReasons for heteroscedasticity:\n\nNon-Linear Relationship: The relationship between study time and scores isn’t straight-line (linear).\nMissing Factors: There could be other factors that affect scores in addition to study time.\nStudy Time Measurement: Perhaps “study time” isn’t measured in the best way. For example, just counting hours might not take into account the quality of the study.\nExtreme Values: There might be students with very high or very low study times that are affecting the prediction errors. These could be outliers, and they might need special attention in your analysis.\nIncorrect Model: You might be using the wrong type of model to make your predictions. Maybe the relationship between study time and scores is more complex than the model you’re using can handle.\n\n\ncheck_h &lt;- check_heteroscedasticity(model1)\nplot(check_h)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\n\nx-axis (Fitted Values): the predicted values by your regression model.\ny-axis (Standardized residuals): the residuals from your model that have been standardized. Standardization typically means subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, so these values are expressed in terms of how many standard deviations they are from the mean residual (which is typically 0).\nConclusion: the plot shows a pattern where the spread of residuals seems to increase with the fitted values — the residuals are quite close together on the left (for smaller fitted values) and spread out more on the right (for larger fitted values). This pattern is called heteroscedasticity, which means the variability of the errors is not consistent across the range of data. This can be problematic for regression models because they assume that the residuals are equally spread across all levels of the independent variables (homoscedasticity)."

If the residuals are randomly dispersed around the horizontal line, it suggests linearity. A pattern or systematic structure in the residuals would suggest non-linearity.\nPosterior Predictive Check: This plot compares the distribution of observed data against the distribution of data predicted by the model. Ideally, the model-predicted data should closely match the observed data, which would mean the model is accurately capturing the data’s distribution. In the plot, if the lines for observed and predicted data are close together, it indicates a good fit.\nInfluential Observations: This plot, often called a Cook’s distance plot, helps identify influential observations. Points that fall outside the dashed lines (contour lines of Cook’s distance) can have a disproportionate influence on the model’s parameters."

In other words, position_jitter() doesn’t represent the actual data points, instead, it represents the data points with slight “error”.\ngeom_hpline(): adds horizontal lines to the plot. These lines are generated from the sampler() function, which creates samples of the dataset exam. sampler(25, group = RACE) means that it will create a subset of the original dataset ‘exam’ with 25 observations from each group defined by the ’RACE’variable.\nheight = 0.6: sets the height of horizontal lines\ntransition_states(.draw, 1, 3): This sets up animation using gganimate. It specifies that the animation should transition between different states based on the column .draw in the dataset, going from draw 1 to draw 3.

In this case, it will go like 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3…\ndraw: In statistical or simulation contexts, a “draw” or “iteration” usually refers to a single execution or realization of a process or simulation.

    "section": "6.2 FunnelPlotR methods",
    "text": "6.2 FunnelPlotR methods\nFunnelPlotR package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a numerator (events of interest), denominator (population to be considered) and group. The key arguments selected for customisation are:\n\nlimit: specify the plot limits, either at the 95% confidence level or the 99% confidence level. This determines the width of the funnel plot and the corresponding confidence intervals around the summary measure.\nlabel_outliers: When set to true, this argument will label outliers on the funnel plot.\nPoisson_limits: Setting this argument to true adds Poisson limits to the plot. Poisson limits are calculated based on the assumption that the events of interest follow a Poisson distribution. These limits help assess whether observed variation in event rates is within the range of random chance.\nPoisson Distribution: describe the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence and the assumption that the events happen independently of each other. When dealing with funnel plots, we often want to assess whether observed variations in event rates (like mortality rates, complication rates, etc.) are within the range of random chance or if they might indicate something significant. Poisson limits in the context of funnel plots help us with this assessment by setting boundaries to check whether the observed data points are within what we’d expect from random variation alone. If data points fall outside these Poisson limits, it suggests that there might be factors other than chance affecting the event rates and warrants further investigation.\nOD_adjust: This argument adds overdispersed limits to the plot when set to true. Overdispersion occurs when there is more variability in the data than expected based on a Poisson distribution.\nxrange and yrange: specify the range to display for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. They act as a zoom function, allowing you to focus on a specific region of interest within the funnel plot.\n\n\n6.2.1 FunnelPlotR methods: The basic plot\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  numerator = covid19$Positive,\n  denominator = covid19$Death,\n  group = covid19$`Sub-district`\n)\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 0 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 1\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  numerator = covid19$Death,\n  denominator = covid19$Positive,\n  group = covid19$`Sub-district`,\n  data_type = \"PR\",     #&lt;&lt;\n  xrange = c(0, 6500),  #&lt;&lt;\n  yrange = c(0, 0.05)   #&lt;&lt;\n)\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Notes\n\n\n\n\ndata_type = \"PR\": determines the type of data being plotted.\nPR stands for “Proportion” or “Prevalence Rate”, while SR(by default) stands for “Standardized Rate” or “Standardized Ratio”.\n\nExample:\nCity A:\nTotal population: 100,000; Number of people with diabetes: 10,000.\nCity B:\nTotal population: 200,000; Number of people with diabetes: 20,000.\nPrevalence Rate (PR):\n\nCity A: (Number of people with diabetes in City A) / (Total population of City A) = 10,000 / 100,000 = 0.1 or 10%\nCity B: (Number of people with diabetes in City A) / (Total population of City A) = 10,000 / 100,000 = 0.1 or 10%\n\nStandardized Rate (SR):\n\nStandard Population: Total population of City A + Total population of City B = 100,000 + 200,000 = 300,000\nCity A: (Number of people with diabetes in City A) / (Total standard population) * 100,000 = (10,000 / 300,000) * 100,000 = 3,333.33 cases per 100,000 population\nCity B: (Number of people with diabetes in City B) / (Total standard population) * 100,000 = (20,000 / 300,000) * 100,000 = 6,666.67 cases per 100,000 population\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 2\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  numerator = covid19$Death,\n  denominator = covid19$Positive,\n  group = covid19$`Sub-district`,\n  data_type = \"PR\",   \n  xrange = c(0, 6500),  \n  yrange = c(0, 0.05),\n  label = NA,\n  title = \"Cumulative COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Cumulative Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases\", #&lt;&lt;           \n  x_label = \"Cumulative COVID-19 Positive Cases\", #&lt;&lt;\n  y_label = \"Cumulative Fatality Rate\"  #&lt;&lt;\n)\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion."
