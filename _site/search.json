    "text": "Here is an office report as shown in the infographic below, after reviewing it, certain figures and statements have captured my attention.\n\n\n\nClimate_change\n\n\nAs shown in “DAILY TEMPERATURE” sector:\n\nFrom 1948 to 2016, annual mean temperatures rose at an average rate of 0.25℃ per decade.\nDaily mean temperatures are projected to increase by 1.4℃ to 4.6℃.\n\nThe annual mean temperatures rose in a slow speed at 0.25℃ per every 10 years. However, the daily mean temperatures are expected to increase by at least 1.4℃ which is nearly equal to the increasement of annual mean temperatures in 60 years. This sounds a bit confusing and need in-depth study."

    "text": "3.2 Data Wrangling\nFirst, I’ll import all data downloaded from website.\n\n\nCode\ndata_1983 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/DAILYDATA_S24_198312.csv\")\ndata_1993 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/DAILYDATA_S24_199312.csv\")\ndata_2003 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/DAILYDATA_S24_200312.csv\")\ndata_2013 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/DAILYDATA_S24_201312.csv\")\ndata_2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/DAILYDATA_S24_202312.csv\")\n\n\nThen, I’ll check all variables in these files.\n\n\nCode\ndata_1983\ndata_1993\ndata_2003\ndata_2013\ndata_2023\n\n\nUpon reviewing the data, there are some issues need to be addressed.\n1. Re-match the values with the correct column\nFor the year 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013, the values of \"Mean Temperature\" are wrongly listed in column \"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\" due to the missing values on \"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\" in these years and the treatment of missing values when imported into R. The values need to be re-matched to column \"Mean Temperature\".\n2. Remove special characters “???” from the values of “Mean Temperature”\nFor the year 1983, 1993, 2003, 2013, the values of \"Mean Temperature\" start with \"???\" which need to be removed.\nThe codes are shown as below:\n\n\nCode\n# Remove \"???\"\ndata_1983$\"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\" &lt;- \n  as.numeric(gsub(\"^\\\\?+\", \"\", data_1983$\"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\")) \ndata_1993$\"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\" &lt;- \n  as.numeric(gsub(\"^\\\\?+\", \"\", data_1993$\"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\"))\ndata_2003$\"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\" &lt;- \n  as.numeric(gsub(\"^\\\\?+\", \"\", data_2003$\"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\"))\ndata_2013$\"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\" &lt;- \n  as.numeric(gsub(\"^\\\\?+\", \"\", data_2013$\"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\")) \n\n# Re-match values to correct column\ndata_1983 &lt;- data_1983 %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Mean Temperature`=`Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)`)\ndata_1993 &lt;- data_1993 %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Mean Temperature`=`Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)`)\ndata_2003 &lt;- data_2003 %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Mean Temperature`=`Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)`)\ndata_2013 &lt;- data_2013 %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Mean Temperature`=`Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)`)\n\n\nAfter pre-processing on data, we move on to prepare these data for further analysis.\n1. Combine the 5 files and focus on the variables need to be analyzed\nHere I pick \"Station\", \"Year\", \"Month\", \"Day\", \"Mean Temperature\" to do the further processing and remove all the other variables.\n\n\nCode\n# Uniform column names among all files\ncolnames(data_2023)[6] &lt;- \"Highest 30 Min Rainfall (mm)\"\ncolnames(data_2023)[7] &lt;- \"Highest 60 Min Rainfall (mm)\"\ncolnames(data_2023)[8] &lt;- \"Highest 120 Min Rainfall (mm)\"\n\n# Combine files and remove columns\ntemperature &lt;- rbind(data_1983, data_1993, data_2003, data_2013, data_2023)\ntemperature &lt;- temperature[, -c(5,6,7,8,10,11,12,13)]\n\n\n2. Combine Year, Month and Day into Date\n\n\nCode\ntemperature$Date &lt;- as.Date(paste(temperature$Year, \n                                  temperature$Month, \n                                  temperature$Day, \n                                  sep = \"-\"), \n                            \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n\n3. Calculate the change on daily mean temperature\nTo study on the increasment of daily mean temperature, I create a new column called \"Mean_Change\" to observe the variance on daily mean temerature. This variable is obtained by subtracting today's daily mean temperature from that of yesterday.\n\n\nCode\ntemperature$Mean_Change &lt;- c(0, diff(temperature$\"Mean Temperature\"))\n\n\n4. Calculate the mean, standard deviation and standard error of daily mean temperature\nHere I apply statistic methods to assess the central tendency and interval estimate regarding the variance on daily mean temperature. I'll calculate statistics such as mean, standard deviation and standard error first and add them to the plot later on.\n\n\nCode\nmy_summary &lt;- temperature %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    n=n(),\n    mean=mean(Mean_Change),\n    sd=sd(Mean_Change)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))"

But in this case, since I need to assess the variation on daily mean temperature, it might be negative or positive depending on whether today’s mean temperature is rising or dropping. So I’ll set the quantitative scale on y axis starting with negative numbers. Y axis title might be “Variation on daily mean temp (Δ℃)”.\nGraph title and subtitle\ncreate an attention-grabbing title together with a descriptive subtitle to bring better understanding to readers.\nCaption\nneed to mark the source of data.\nCall-outs of important information\nImportant information here refer to the mean and confidence interval of the change on daily mean temperature.
